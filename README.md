## Algorithm study with Python

Here I will upload my solution way of several algorithm problems. So It is not the best way, however, if I find a better solution ,though I solved already, then I will add better solution also. Not just to solve But to know the optimal logic.

> Personal Goal
* Pass the online programming test from companies
* Study several important algorithms with code
* Learn a train of optimal and better logical thoguht
* Solve One problem per two days

> This .md file will be updated after getting below goals!
